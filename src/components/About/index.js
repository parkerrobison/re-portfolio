                        Hello! My name is Parker Robison. I am a Full Stack Developer and Iâ€™m seeking to apply my skills with a quality driven team to create remarkable user experiences. 
                        I recently earned a certificate in full stack development from the University of Utah. I am familiar with Javascript, CSS, React.js, Node.js and mySQL. 
                        I have exceptional organizational skills, a commitment to developing solid apps, and a determination to learn new technologies.
                        Aside from coding, I enjoy hiking, baking, watching movies, photography, listening to music, and being active in general.
